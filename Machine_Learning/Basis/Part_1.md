## Bias and Variance
* **Bias** and **Variance** are used to evaluate two aspectss of model generalization error
  * The **Bias** of model refers to the difference between the expected value predicted by the model and true value;
  * The **Variance** of model refers to the sum of the square difference between the expected value and predicted value predicted by the model
* In **Supervise Learning**, model generalization error comes from the sum of **Bias**, **Vairance** and **Noise**
* **Bias** is used to describe **model fitting ability**</br>
  **Variance** is used to describe **model stability**
