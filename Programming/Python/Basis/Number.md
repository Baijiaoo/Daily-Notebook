## Defination of Number
The Python Number data type is used to store numeric values</br>
The data type is not allowed to change, which means that if you change the value of the Number data type, the memory space will be reassigned.</br>
</br>
Python supports four different numeric types:
* **Int** - Usually referred to as an integer or integer, is a positive or negative integer without a decimal point.
* **Long integers** - Infinite integers, the integer is an uppercase or lowercase L.
* **Float** - The floating point type consists of an integer part and a fractional part. The floating point type can also be expressed in scientific notation (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 102 = 250)
* **Complex** - Complex numbers consist of real and imaginary parts, which can be represented by `a + bj`, or `complex(a,b)`. The real part `a` and the imaginary part `b` of the complex number are both **float**.

### Number type transforamtion
|Function         |Description        |
|========         |===========        |
|int(x,[,base])   |Transfer x to integer|
|long(x,[,base])  |Transfer x to long integer|
|float(x,[,base]) |Transfer x to float|
